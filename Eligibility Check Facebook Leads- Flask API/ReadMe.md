# RESTful API 
## Representational state transfer architectural style.

A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. 
That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.

# What is SOAP vs REST?
SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern. 

SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications while REST uses Uniform Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device. 

SOAP needs more bandwidth for its usage whereas REST doesn't need much bandwidth

REST allows a greater variety of data formats, whereas SOAP only allows XML. Coupled with JSON (which typically works better with data and offers faster parsing), REST is generally considered easier to work with.


# Flask API and comparision
Flask allows Python developers to create lightweight RESTful APIs
Flask provides support for API while Django doesn't have any support for API. 
Flask does not support dynamic HTML pages and Django offers dynamic HTML pages. 
Flask is a Python web framework built for rapid development whereas Django is built for easy and simple projects.
FastAPI is actually known as one of the fastest Python web frameworks. Better performance than Flask API.
