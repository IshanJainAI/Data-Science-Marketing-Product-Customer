# Data Science and Analytics for Marketing, Product and Customer Analytics

Marketing analytics is the practice of measuring, managing and analyzing marketing performance to maximize its effectiveness and optimize return on investment (ROI).

Product analytics is the process of analyzing how users engage with a product or service. It enables product teams to track, visualize, and analyze user engagement and behavior data. Teams use this data to improve and optimize a product or service.

Customer analytics is the use of data to understand the composition, needs and satisfaction of the customer. Also, the enabling technology used to segment buyers into groupings based on behavior, to determine general trends, or to develop targeted marketing and sales activities.


# What can you do with marketing analytics?
With analytics, you can answer questions like these:

1. How are our marketing activities performing today? How about in the long run? What can we do to improve them?
2. How do our marketing activities compare with our competitors? Where are they spending their marketing dollars? Are they using channels that we arenâ€™t using?
3. What should we do next? Are our marketing resources properly allocated? Are we devoting time and money to the right channels? How should we prioritize our investments over a certain time period?
